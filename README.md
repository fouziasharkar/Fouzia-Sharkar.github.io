#### Analyzing students’ concentration in online courses through Webcam 
[Thesis Paper](file/Thesis.pdf)

A significant problem that has emerged with the rising popularity of MOOC platforms is the lower course completion rates
or student dropout rates. Our objective was to close this gap, therefore we applied deep learning to measure students’
concentration levels and determine how much their focus affects their performance. Created our own dataset.
For this project we used tools like Tensorflow and Keras.
